# Proton Compatibility

Unifideck runs Windows games through Proton/umu in a per-game Wine prefix. By default it
uses the **latest GE-Proton**, auto-downloaded from GitHub on first use and cached.
**Proton Experimental** is the offline fallback if GE-Proton can't be fetched or installed.

You normally don't need to do anything — the default works for most games. When a game needs
a specific Proton, set it through **Steam's native compatibility tool** (below).

---

## Choosing a Proton version

Pick the Proton tool the same way you would for any non-Steam game, via Steam:

1. Open the game's **Properties** — on the Unifideck game page, the **⚙ App Settings** button
   opens Steam's menu; or right-click the game in your Library → **Properties**.
2. Go to **Compatibility**.
3. Tick **"Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool"** and choose a tool
   (e.g. a `GE-Proton…` version or `Proton Experimental`).

Unifideck detects this choice, remembers it per-game (saved to
`~/.local/share/unifideck/proton_settings.json`), and applies it when the game launches. It
also clears Steam's force-compat flag at launch so the game doesn't get wrapped in Proton
twice — your selection still shows in the Properties dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't choose Proton in the Unifideck panel itself — there's no in-plugin Proton picker.
> The Steam Compatibility dropdown is the supported way.

### Selection priority

When launching, Unifideck picks the Proton tool in this order:

1. **Per-game choice** — the tool you forced via Steam's Compatibility dropdown
   (`proton_settings.json`).
2. **Steam's own compat override** for that shortcut (`localconfig.vdf`).
3. **Unifideck global default**, if set (`config.json` → `compat.proton_tool`).
4. **Latest GE-Proton** — auto-downloaded and cached (the default).
5. **Proton Experimental** — offline fallback only.

## Troubleshooting & quick fixes

**The game won't launch, or you see "Path Not Found".**
The per-game Wine prefix may be missing or half-created. Delete it and relaunch — Unifideck
rebuilds it automatically:

```
rm -rf ~/.local/share/unifideck/prefixes/<game_id>
```

(Ubisoft games may store their prefix at a custom path recorded in
`~/.local/share/unifideck/ubisoft_id_map.json`.)

**It shows "Downloading Proton" and then fails.**
GE-Proton is fetched from GitHub on first use, so it needs an internet connection. If the
download fails (offline, GitHub rate-limited, interrupted extract), Unifideck falls back to
Proton Experimental. Relaunch when you're back online and it will retry, then cache the
result for next time.

**"No compatibility tool" / nothing to run.**
Make sure Steam has at least one Proton available — run Steam once, or install a Proton/
GE-Proton. Unifideck needs either GE-Proton or Proton Experimental present.

**A specific game crashes or misbehaves with the default Proton.**
Force a different tool via the Steam Compatibility dropdown (above) — try the latest
GE-Proton or Proton Experimental, and check the game on [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/)
for per-game tips.

**Missing runtime dependencies (DXVK, Visual C++, etc.).**
Unifideck runs the usual prefix setup (winetricks/vcredist/DXVK) best-effort when it creates
the prefix. If a game is missing something, delete the prefix (above) and relaunch to
re-run setup.

**Game-specific environment tweaks.**
Some issues are fixed with environment variables (e.g. `PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1`,
`PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1`/`PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1`, `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=...`). These can be set via the
shortcut's launch options — see **[Launch Options](launch-options.md)** for the exact syntax
and caveats.

## Picking Proton from launch options (`PROTON=` / `PROTONPATH=`)

> [!WARNING]
> **Not currently supported.** Selecting Proton with `PROTON=GE-Proton…` or `PROTONPATH=…` in
> a game's launch options does **not** work in the current build — the launcher overwrites
> `PROTONPATH` itself, and the launch-option parser that handled `PROTON=` isn't wired into
> the launch path. Use the [Steam Compatibility dropdown](#choosing-a-proton-version)
> instead. (`PROTON=` was supported in earlier 0.x releases and is intended to return — see
> [Launch Options → Planned](launch-options.md#planned--not-yet-wired).)

GE-Proton includes additional patches and fixes not present in official Proton, which is why
Unifideck defaults to it.
