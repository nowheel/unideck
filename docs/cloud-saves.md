# Cloud Saves

Unifideck can sync your game saves to and from each store's cloud for **GOG** and
**Epic** games, so your progress follows you between devices. This page explains
how it works, what the cloud‑save button does, and how to fix the common cases
where a game's saves can't be found automatically.

> **Which games?** Cloud saves apply to **GOG** and **Epic** games launched
> through Unifideck. Steam games use Steam's own cloud (handled by Steam).
> Amazon, Ubisoft, and xCloud titles are not covered by this feature.

## How it works

### Finding where a game keeps its saves

The hardest part of cloud saves is knowing **where** a game reads and writes its
save files inside its Windows (Proton) prefix. Unifideck resolves this in order,
using the first method that succeeds:

1. **Your manual override** — a save location you set yourself (see
   [Set a custom save location](#set-a-custom-save-location)).
2. **The store's own metadata** — Epic's `legendary` metadata, or GOG's cloud‑save
   configuration fetched from GOG's cloud‑storage API. This is the most
   authoritative source, and it also lets Unifideck show the **real** cloud copy's
   file count and timestamp (not just the last copy it cached locally).
3. **Community save‑location database** — paths sourced from
   [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/) (via the
   [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest) project) and baked
   into Unifideck's game database. This covers the large majority of games. It is a
   local, prebaked database — there is no live web lookup.
4. **Prefix auto‑detect** — scanning the game's Proton prefix for a save folder
   that matches the game's title (under the usual Windows locations: `Saved Games`,
   `Documents`, `AppData/Local`, `AppData/Roaming`).

If none of these resolve a location, the cloud‑save button shows **"Save location
not found"** until you either launch the game (so the prefix exists) or set a
location manually.

Path templates from these sources (e.g. `%APPDATA%/MyGame/Saves`, or a folder
next to the game's install directory) are resolved against the game's actual
Proton prefix and **your chosen install location** (games can live on the SD card
or an external drive; saves are found wherever the game actually writes them).

### When saves sync

- **Download (cloud → device) happens automatically when you launch a game.**
  This direction is safe: Unifideck takes a snapshot first and never deletes your
  local saves.
- **Upload (device → cloud) is manual by default.** Uploading is the only
  direction that can overwrite what's in the cloud, so Unifideck leaves it under
  your control via the cloud‑save button. You can change this — see
  [Settings](#settings-auto-pull--manual-push).

## The cloud‑save button

On a GOG/Epic game's page, a **cloud icon** sits in the button row next to
**Play**. Its appearance tells you the save state at a glance:

| Icon             | Meaning                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ☁️ Cloud (plain) | Cloud saves supported; nothing needs attention                  |
| ☁️⬇️ green dot   | Cloud saves are available to download                           |
| ☁️ amber ring    | **Save location not found** — sync may not work yet (see below) |
| 🔄 spinning      | A sync is in progress                                           |
| ☁️ dimmed        | This game has no cloud‑save support                             |

Selecting the icon opens the **Cloud saves** window, which shows:

- **Local** — how many save files are on this device, their size, and when they
  were last changed.
- **Cloud** — the same for the most recent copy Unifideck has of the cloud saves.
- **Download cloud save** — pull the cloud copy onto this device now.
- **Upload local save** — push this device's saves to the cloud now.

## Settings: auto‑pull / manual push

Two settings control automatic syncing (in the plugin config under `cloud`):

| Setting               | Default | Effect                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto_pull_on_launch` | `true`  | Download cloud saves automatically when a game launches. |
| `auto_push_on_stop`   | `false` | Upload local saves automatically when a game exits.      |

- Leaving the defaults gives you **auto‑download + manual upload** — the safest
  balance, and the recommended setup.
- Set `auto_push_on_stop` to `true` to restore **fully automatic** two‑way sync.
- Set both to `false` to make **everything manual** via the button.

Other keys under `cloud` you normally don't need to touch: `enabled` (master
on/off, default `true`), `tolerance_seconds` (how much clock drift counts as
"same", default `2`), and `sync_wait_timeout_seconds` (how long to wait for a
concurrent sync to finish, default `30`).

---

## Safety: your cloud saves won't be wiped

Uploading is guarded so a bad local state can't destroy good cloud saves:

- **Empty or settings‑only folders are never uploaded.** If Unifideck would be
  pushing nothing but config files (or an empty folder), the upload is blocked.
- **Regressions are caught.** If files that were there at the last sync have gone
  missing locally, Unifideck stops and asks you which copy to keep instead of
  silently overwriting the cloud.
- **Versioned local backups.** Before each upload, Unifideck snapshots your local
  saves to `~/.local/share/unifideck/save_backups/<store>/<game id>/<timestamp>/`
  (the newest five are kept), so a mistake is recoverable.

When local and cloud genuinely disagree, you'll get a **conflict prompt** showing
both copies (file counts, sizes, timestamps) and a choice of **Use Cloud** or
**Use Local**.

## Troubleshooting

### "Save location not found — sync may not work for this game"

This warning means Unifideck couldn't determine where the game reads/writes its
saves yet. The most common reasons:

**1. You haven't launched the game on this device yet.**
A game's save folder lives inside its Proton prefix, which **doesn't exist until
the first launch**. Until then there's no real location to sync to.

> **Fix:** Launch the game once. Unifideck creates the prefix, resolves the real
> save folder, and a cloud download then brings your saves into it. After that the
> cloud‑save button works normally.

**2. The game's save location isn't in our database and couldn't be auto‑detected.**
Some games store saves in unusual places.

> **Fix:** [Set a custom save location](#set-a-custom-save-location) yourself.

### The cloud shows saves, but download fails

If the game hasn't been launched yet, there's no Proton prefix and therefore no
valid destination folder to download into. Sync can't complete until the prefix
exists. **Launch the game once**, then use the button.

### Set a custom save location

If auto‑detection fails but you know where the game keeps its saves (for example
after launching it once and checking inside its prefix), open the **Cloud saves**
window and choose **Set save location** to pick the folder. Unifideck saves this
as a per‑game override and always prefers it from then on.

### The cloud icon is dimmed / "No cloud‑save support"

Not every game offers cloud saves on every store. If the store doesn't support
cloud saves for that title, there's nothing to sync — this is expected, not an
error. (For example, many Epic titles have no cloud‑save support at all.)

### My game is on the SD card / a custom location

Fully supported. Game files can be installed anywhere; only the Proton prefix
stays in Unifideck's data folder. Saves are resolved against your actual install
location automatically.

## Where things are stored on your device

| What                                         | Location                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Game prefixes (where in‑prefix saves live)   | `~/.local/share/unifideck/prefixes/<game id>/`                   |
| Versioned pre‑upload backups (newest 5 kept) | `~/.local/share/unifideck/save_backups/<store>/<game id>/<ts>/`  |
| Local backup mirror (write‑only copy)        | `~/Save Games Backup/<store>/<game id>/`                         |

> The `~/Save Games Backup/` mirror is a **write‑only safety copy** — Unifideck
> writes to it but never restores from it. Your real saves always live inside the
> game's Proton prefix; the cloud is the source of truth for syncing.
