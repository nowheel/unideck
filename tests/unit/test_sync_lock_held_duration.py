"""Regression: a queued sync request logs how long the lock has been held.

UD-013: after a store login, both auto-sync-on-login (``request_auth_sync``)
and a manual "Sync" click appeared to silently do nothing until a full Steam
restart. The suspected mechanism is ``SyncService._lock`` getting wedged
forever by a stuck handler inside an ``EventBus.emit`` fan-out (see
``tests/event_bus/test_event_bus.py`` for that fix) — every subsequent
``sync_all``/``request_auth_sync`` call then queues behind a lock that never
releases. ``_enqueue`` already logged "queued behind in-flight" whenever a
caller found the lock held, but didn't say for how long — the one fact that
distinguishes a merely slow legitimate sync from a permanently stuck one.
This test locks in that the held duration is now included.
