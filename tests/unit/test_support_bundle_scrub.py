"""Tests for the Capture Logs content scrubber.

Two halves, and the second matters as much as the first:

1. credentials get masked;
2. **the diagnostic content survives.** Over-redaction would quietly
   destroy the value of the very logs we are collecting, so the
   preservation tests are not decoration — they are the constraint that
   keeps the rules honest.
