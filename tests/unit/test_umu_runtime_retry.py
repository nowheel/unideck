"""Unit tests for ``run_umu_with_retry``'s recoverable-code retry branch.

Regression (UD-022): a GOG game launched through forced compatibility
returned an umu recoverable exit code (2 / 74 / 127) and the plugin
showed a toast titled "Network Error" while wiping the *shared*
steamrt runtime cache (hundreds of MB, re-downloaded on the next
launch of any game) on EVERY recoverable code. The title was a
misdiagnosis (127 = command-not-found, 2/74 = umu bootstrap failure —
none are network errors) and the blanket cache nuke was wasteful.

These tests pin the fixed semantics:
  * the retry toast title is now ``toasts.launcher.launchRetry``, never
    ``networkError``;
  * the shared runtime cache is wiped ONLY for the corruption codes
    (2, 74), NOT for 127;
  * a non-recoverable code returns immediately without a toast or wipe.

The retry loop is exercised without a real umu by scripting
``_run_umu_once`` to return a sequence of exit codes, and the 3s
backoff is neutered so the suite stays sub-second.
