"""Tests for the canonical prefix setup's timeout → managed-GE retry + pin.

The "create prefix + install redistributables" process is now a single
:func:`unifideck.launcher.proton.setup_prefix`, reused by install-time warmup
AND first launch. A structurally-complete but runtime-hanging Proton wedges
setup; ``apply_prefix_compat`` reports when a step was force-killed for timing
out, and ``setup_prefix`` retries the setup ONCE with the plugin-managed
GE-Proton, then PINS whichever Proton succeeded so the next launch reuses it
directly (no prefix reset, no dependency reinstall).

These tests pin: retry-with-GE on timeout; no retry when the hung Proton WAS
already GE (no loop); no retry on a clean run; and the pin (marker + saved
setting) only on a recovery. They target ``setup_prefix`` directly — the same
unit both the warmup adapter and the launch orchestrator call.

(An earlier revision inserted a repair-in-place rung here — official Protons via
SteamClient.Apps.VerifyApp, GE via re-install — between the default attempt and
the GE switch. Removed: across every hang it fired on live, VerifyApp reported
success but the same-Proton retry hung again regardless, so it never changed the
outcome. The actual install-warmup hang was a missing user-session env for
install-time umu runs, fixed in ``_user_session_env`` — see
test_warmup_session_env.py and memory install-hang-orphaned-wineserver-lock.md.)
