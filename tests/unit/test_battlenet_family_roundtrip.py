"""The family code must survive the trip from catalog to launcher.

This is the gap that made every Battle.net game unlaunchable. The family
code (``--exec="launch <FAMILY>"``) is known only inside the catalog join in
``library.build_library``, which puts it on ``Game.metadata["family"]``. The
launcher runs out-of-process under the system Python and cannot reach the
catalog, so it reads the family back out of ``battlenet_id_map.json``.

Nothing wrote it there. ``install_game`` merged only ``prefix_path`` and
``mark_launch_ok`` had no production caller, so ``resolve_family`` returned
``None`` for every uid and both launch handlers aborted with
``battlenetFamilyMissing``. On-device the id map did not exist at all.

Every test here crosses the boundary — backend writer to launcher reader —
because both halves passing in isolation is exactly what shipped.
