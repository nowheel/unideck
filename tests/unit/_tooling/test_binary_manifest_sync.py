"""Guard test — bundled-binary versions must agree across all three sources.

A bundled store CLI is pinned in three places that nothing links together:

1. ``package.json`` ``remote_binary[]`` — URL + ``sha256hash``. Decky reads
   this at install time and verifies the download against the hash.
2. ``build-plugin.sh`` ``<TOOL>_URL`` — the same URLs, hardcoded a second
   time because ``prebuild_binaries()`` runs before any JSON parsing is
   available to it. Its own header comment says the two "must stay in sync"
   and points at this test.
3. ``core/binaries/binary_signatures.py`` ``_KNOWN_HASHES`` — the runtime
   check that the file on disk is the pinned version, whose docstring
   requires updating "IN THE SAME COMMIT as the binary update".

Three hand-maintained copies of the same fact drift the moment someone
bumps a version and updates two of them. The failure is quiet and nasty:
the build downloads one version while the manifest advertises another, so
Decky's install-time hash check rejects it, or the runtime signature check
reports a mismatch on a binary that is perfectly fine.

De-duplicating these properly is roadmap item #7. Until then this test is
the seam that makes a partial bump fail loudly, in CI, immediately.
