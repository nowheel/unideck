"""Find stale ``compatdata`` prefixes left behind by older launch paths.

py_modules/unifideck/services/shortcut/compatdata_scan.py

Before the ``compatdata`` bridge existed, launching a Unifideck shortcut with
a compat tool assigned made **Steam** create a full Proton prefix at
``steamapps/compatdata/<appid>`` — 300–800 MB each. Those prefixes are dead
weight: the launcher sets ``WINEPREFIX`` to our own per-game directory, so
the game never reads them. Nothing pruned them on uninstall either, so they
accumulate, and Protontricks lists them *instead of* the real prefix — the
user edits a prefix the game does not use.

Every entry is classified into exactly one of three buckets:

``unifideck``  the appid maps to a shortcut tagged as ours;
``orphan``     no shortcut with that appid exists at all;
``user``       someone else's non-Steam shortcut.

Bridge symlinks created by ``core.compat_bridge`` are skipped outright — they
are not directories on disk and must never be reported as reclaimable.

Deletion requires a **marker found inside the directory**, not the appid
classification. This runs unattended at boot, with no confirmation dialog to
show the user a list first, so the identification has to be positive proof
rather than inference:

* Every prefix Unifideck initialises gets ``.unifideck*`` files written into
  it — ``.unifideck_proton_version`` (see ``compat/prefix_init``),
  ``.unifideck_legacy_migrated``, ``.unifideck_vcreg_*.done``,
  ``unifideck_winetricks_complete.marker``, the GOG setup markers, and
  ``.unifideck_prereqs_<game_id>_*.done``, which even names the game. A
  ``compatdata`` directory carrying any of them is one *we* set up.
* Nothing else writes them. Verified on the dev Deck: every managed prefix has
  at least one, and the user's own non-Steam prefixes (*The Last of Us* Part I
  and II, 1.01 GB) have none.
* Because the marker is *in* the directory, this survives uninstall — which
  appid-based attribution cannot, since ``games.map`` drops the row and
  nothing then links the leftover to us.

The appid classification is kept only as a veto: ``CLASS_USER`` is never
deletable even if a marker somehow appeared. It is deliberately NOT used to
authorise deletion. ``CLASS_ORPHAN`` used to be deletable on the reasoning
that no shortcut claims the appid, but that infers "safe" from *absence* and
inverts catastrophically when ``shortcuts.vdf`` loads empty or partial: the
index goes empty, every directory becomes ``orphan``, and the sweep proposes
deleting all of them, including the user's own. An empty ``shortcuts.vdf`` is
not hypothetical here — NonSteamLaunchers rewrites the file, and boot is when
it is least reliably readable.

Bridge symlinks created by ``core.compat_bridge`` are skipped outright — they
are not directories on disk and must never be reported as reclaimable, which
is also what keeps a live game's real prefix out of reach.

Note there is no staleness *test*: redundancy follows from the launcher always
pointing ``WINEPREFIX`` at our own per-game directory. ``atime`` is useless as
an "in use" signal because :func:`_dir_size_bytes` walks the tree and updates
it; ``mtime`` survives a read and is reported for diagnostics.

Read-only. Deletion is the caller's job (``services/prefix_bridge``).
