"""services/size_backfill.py — post-sync warm-up of the download-size cache.

"Space Required" is fetched lazily, per game, the first time its App-Details
page opens. That lookup is a live store call — ``legendary info`` for Epic,
the gogdl install planner for GOG, ``nile install --info`` for Amazon — each a
network round-trip taking seconds. The result is already persisted
(:class:`~unifideck.services.size_cache.SizeCache`), so the cost is paid once
per game, but it is paid *in front of the user*: on a real device only 51 of
611 owned Epic/GOG/Amazon games had a cached size, so ~92% of page opens sat
on a visible multi-second gap before the number appeared.

This walks the library in the background after a sync and fills the same
cache, so by the time a page is opened the value is already there.

Deliberately NOT a registered post-sync phase. ``SyncService`` gates
``mark_complete`` on every registered phase reporting done; a long network
walk that can be cancelled or stall would risk stranding the progress bar at
<100% (the failure mode called out in ``MetadataService._on_sync_complete``).
Instead this is fire-and-forget, exactly like ``metadata_backfill``: the sync
UI completes immediately and sizes land quietly as they resolve.
