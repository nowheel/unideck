"""Per-game disk facts for the QAM "Installed" list.

py_modules/unifideck/services/installed_disk_info.py

Answers two questions for every *installed* game in one round trip:

* **How big is it on disk** — the exact directory walk shared with
  App-Details (:func:`~unifideck.stores.shared.installed_size.installed_size_bytes`).
* **Where does it live** — ``internal`` or ``external``.

Why a bulk collector rather than N per-row calls to
``get_game_size_bytes``: an installed size is an uncached recursive
``scandir`` walk (:mod:`unifideck.services.size_cache` deliberately
excludes installed games, since the number moves with saves/updates/DLC).
Firing one walk per row every time the Quick-Access panel opens would
mean a dozen concurrent walks over tens of gigabytes — on a Deck that is
disk contention the user feels while a game is running. Here the walks
are semaphore-bounded and memoised for :data:`MEMO_TTL_S`, so a repeat
panel open costs nothing.

Best-effort throughout: a game whose size or location cannot be resolved
is simply omitted from the result, so the row renders without a meta
line rather than the whole list failing.
