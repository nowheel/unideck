"""services/metadata_service.py — Game metadata resolver.

EventBus subscriber enriching ``Game`` objects with metadata
from 3 sources in priority order:
1. Steam Store — matches non-Steam games to their Steam app_id
   when one exists (real description, images, genres).
2. UnifiDB — Unifideck's own game database (niche + non-Steam).
3. Metacritic — scores and review summaries.

All responses cached (CacheManager) with a 7-day TTL to avoid
