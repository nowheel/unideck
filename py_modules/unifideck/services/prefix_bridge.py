"""Keep ``compatdata`` bridge links in sync with the installed games.

py_modules/unifideck/services/prefix_bridge.py

One sweep that makes external Wine tooling (Protontricks) agree with
reality. It is driven by ``games.map``, which lists exactly the games that
are *installed* and carries the canonical Steam ``app_id`` in its v3 column —
so "installed games only" falls out of the data source rather than needing a
separate install-state query. Recomputing the appid here would be wrong:
``generate_app_id`` is anchored on the launcher **exe path**, so a derived id
does not match the stored one (verified on-device).

Three actions, all idempotent:

1. link every installed game's prefix into ``steamapps/compatdata/<appid>``;
2. prune bridge links whose prefix is gone — this is what makes an uninstall
   (or a manual prefix deletion, or a half-failed uninstall) drop out of
   Protontricks, with no hook needed in any per-store uninstall path;
3. ensure the Protontricks Flatpak can actually read the prefixes dir.

Running it on a schedule rather than wiring each store's uninstall keeps the
logic in one place and driven by ground truth (does the prefix exist?),
instead of five call sites that can each forget.
