"""Download data models — the per-item record + error classification.

OP-15c | py_modules/unifideck/services/download/models.py

``DownloadItem`` is the frozen dataclass describing one queued
download : store, game_id, target path, language, current state
(queued / running / paused / done / failed), progress (bytes done
+ total, ETA), failure code if any.

``classify_download_error`` is the helper that turns an
``InstallResult.error`` string from a store-side installer into a
typed enum value the UI can render.
