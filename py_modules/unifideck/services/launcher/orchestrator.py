"""services/launcher/orchestrator.py — Per-platform launch entry points.

2 public orchestrators:
- ``launch_windows`` — Proton-wrapped pipeline (prepare plan,
  sync down, run subprocess, sync up).
- ``launch_native`` — native Linux, simpler: cloud sync wraps
  a direct subprocess, no Proton/umu/prefix setup.
``LauncherService.launch`` dispatches between them based on
``ctx.is_windows_game``. Heavy lifting in ``helpers.py``.
