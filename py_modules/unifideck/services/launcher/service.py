"""services/launcher/service.py — LauncherService DI facade.

Single entry point used by main.py and the dispatcher CLI. Holds
references to existing services (ShortcutService, ProtonService,
CloudSaveService, EdgeBrowser) and orchestrates a single launch
end-to-end. No logic duplication — all non-trivial work is
delegated. The remaining code here is dispatch + signal wiring +
launch stage events + CLI-tool subprocess wrapping.
