"""Epic Selective Downloads (SDL) — resolve legendary install tags.

OP-48j | py_modules/unifideck/stores/epic/sdl.py

legendary supports *selective downloads* for a set of titles: the
manifest tags optional files (language/voice packs, HD textures,
Fortnite's Save the World) and the CLI asks which of them to include.
That question is a bare ``input()`` inside
``legendary/utils/cli.py::sdl_prompt`` and — unlike every other prompt
in the install path — ``--yes`` does **not** suppress it. Spawned from
the Decky backend with no usable stdin it raises ``EOFError``, which
aborted the install outright for every SDL title (UD-026: Fallout 3
GOTY and Fallout: New Vegas, Hogwarts Legacy, Cyberpunk 2077, …).

So we answer the question ourselves, up front, and pass explicit
``--install-tag`` values instead:

* ``""`` — the base game's untagged files, always;
* every ``__required`` tag the config declares;
* every **non-language** extra (``hd_textures``, Fortnite's ``stw``) —
  content a user would want, and the only two such tags in the whole
  catalog;
* exactly **one** language pack, matched to the user's language, so a
  Deck doesn't swallow nine voice packs it will never play.

Which titles are SDL titles is **not** the hardcoded table in
legendary's ``utils/selective_dl.py`` — that is only a fallback.
``LegendaryCore`` injects every app_name from the remote
``game_overrides.sdl_config`` into its table, so the authoritative
list is legendary's own cached ``version.json`` (rewritten on any
legendary run). Reading that file is also why this needs no extra
subprocess. Mistaking the fallback table for the real list is what
made UD-026 rule SDL out and misdiagnose the bug for two releases.

Every lookup degrades quietly: a non-SDL title, a cache miss with no
network, or a malformed payload all yield "no tags", and the caller
falls back to ``--skip-sdl`` (required data only) rather than failing
the install.
