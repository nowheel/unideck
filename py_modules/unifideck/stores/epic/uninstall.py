"""Epic uninstall primitives — file removal + legendary bookkeeping.

OP-48k | py_modules/unifideck/stores/epic/uninstall.py

Extracted from ``install.py`` when that module hit the volumetry cap.
These are the mechanics ``EpicInstaller.uninstall_game`` orchestrates;
it keeps the policy (what order, what to report) and they do the work.

Why any of this exists: ``legendary uninstall`` cannot be trusted to
delete files. Its per-game catalog lookup can fail with HTTP 401 (expired
Epic auth), after which it **skips the deletion but still exits 0**,
printing "please remove <path> manually". So the install directory is
resolved from legendary's *local* ``installed.json`` (no network), the
CLI is run only as best-effort metadata cleanup, and the deletion plus
the registry purge are done here.

All functions are free functions taking what they need explicitly — they
never touched installer state beyond the CLI path and its timeout.

.. note::
   ``_is_safe_to_delete`` duplicates ``unifideck.core.safe_delete`` (OP-58),
   which is stricter: it resolves symlinks, rejects every ancestor of
   ``$HOME``, and requires depth ≥ 4 where this requires ≥ 3.
   Consolidating is worth doing, but it *tightens* deletion — a custom
   install root like ``/games/Foo`` (3 parts) is allowed here and would be
   refused there — so it needs its own change with its own testing rather
   than riding along with an unrelated fix.
