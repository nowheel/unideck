    """A ``UbisoftSession`` wired from on-disk defaults alone.

    The normal session is built by ``stores/ubisoft/specialists.py`` from the
    live plugin's ``ConfigManager``. The out-of-process launcher has neither,
    but its last-resort prefix recovery still has to inject credentials — a
    prefix rebuilt without them makes UPC demand a sign-in for a user who is
    already signed in. Duplicating the credential logic there was the
    alternative, and this package already has four hand-rolled copies of the
    Ubisoft prefix resolver to show where that leads.

    Stdlib-only at import time (verified under system python 3.13), matching
    the launcher's constraint. Config lookups fall back to their defaults and
    log a "forgotten ConfigManager" notice — expected here, not a bug.
