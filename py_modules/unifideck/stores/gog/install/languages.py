"""Language matching utility — re-export shim.

OP-51c | py_modules/unifideck/stores/gog/install/languages.py

Both functions now live in ``unifideck.utils.lang_normalize``:

* ``normalize_language(raw)`` → ISO 639-1 base code, and
* ``smart_match_language(requested, supported)`` → the best of the
  labels a title actually offers.

They were hoisted out of this GOG-scoped module when Epic needed the
same matching for legendary's SDL install tags — a store package must
not import another store's internals. This shim stays so existing
importers (and tests) can keep importing either name from here.

The shared module mirrors the frontend
``src/lib/i18n/gog-language-match.ts``.
