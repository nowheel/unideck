"""launcher/proton/prefix_setup.py — the ONE canonical prefix setup.

Historically the "create the Wine prefix + install redistributables" process
had two divergent implementations that could disagree on which Proton to use:

* install-time **warmup** (``services/download/prefix_warmup.py``) ran
  createprefix + compat and, on a runtime hang, retried once with the managed
  GE-Proton — but recorded nothing about the Proton it succeeded with; and
* first **launch** (``services/launcher/orchestrator.py``) ran createprefix
  (Phase 1.5) then compat (inside ``proton.dispatch``) exactly once, with NO
  hang recovery and NO record.

So warmup could recover to GE-Proton while launch independently re-picked the
user's (hanging) global-default Proton, saw a "Proton family change", wiped the
just-warmed prefix, and re-ran the whole setup at Play time — throwing warmup's
work away (observed live: Rise of the Tomb Raider, 2026-07-22).

:func:`setup_prefix` is the single source of truth both paths now call. It runs
the identical, self-healing setup and — crucially — **pins the Proton it
actually succeeded with** (``proton_settings.json`` tier-1 + the prefix's
``.unifideck_proton_version`` marker) so the next launch resolves the SAME
Proton and does a fast no-op instead of a full redo. Whichever path runs first
wins and pins; the other becomes a genuine no-op.

Lives in ``launcher/`` (not ``services/``) because it runs under the system
``/usr/bin/python3`` out-of-process: stdlib-only at import time. The one write
into the aiohttp-heavy ``compatibility`` package (``save_proton_setting``) is
imported lazily inside the function, exactly as ``compat/ge_fallback.py`` does.
