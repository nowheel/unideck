"""compat/vcruntime.py — VC++ runtime registry fix for UE4-class titles.

UE4 launcher stubs call ``MsiQueryProductState`` to verify VC++ is
installed; winetricks copies the DLLs but doesn't populate the MSI
product database, and Proton rewrites ``system.reg`` on prefix
upgrades — erasing text-injected keys. This imports a bundled ``.reg``
via ``umu-run regedit`` *after* Proton has initialised the prefix
(winetricks runs first in :mod:`compat`). The marker is keyed to the
Proton tool name so it re-runs when the user switches Proton. Generic
across stores; best-effort.

# trivial 4-key registry import that finishes in well under a second on

# one), so a good Proton retries it next launch.

# which could not see the case that actually erases the keys: any Proton other
# than the one we imported under running ``wineboot -u`` on the prefix
# ("Upgrading prefix from X to Y") and rewriting ``system.reg``. The old marker
# for OUR tool was still sitting there, so the import was skipped forever and
# the prefix stayed permanently without the keys. Comparing against Proton's
# ``version`` file instead detects every rewrite — a user Proton switch, or a
# Proton Steam handed the game directly — because Proton restamps it each time.
#
# Name keeps the ``.unifideck_vcreg_`` prefix so ``prefix_init``'s
# ``_clear_stale_compat_markers`` still matches it on a fresh createprefix.
