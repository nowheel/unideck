"""launcher.proton.compat — per-prefix compatibility setup.

A single :func:`apply_prefix_compat` entry, run once before every
Windows game launches (from ``proton.dispatch``), performing the
store-agnostic prefix preparation that any Windows title may need:

* redistributables (winetricks: VC++ runtimes, d3dcompiler, …)
* the VC++ runtime registry fix (UE4 ``MsiQueryProductState``)

Store-specific compatibility lives alongside but is invoked from the
per-store handlers, not here:

* Epic   → :mod:`compat.epic` (EOS overlay, config path, offline)
* GOG    → galaxy stub (``fixes.galaxy_stub``)
* Amazon → fuel.json args (handler)

**Ubisoft is skipped entirely** — its games launch *through* Ubisoft
Connect (UPC), which installs the redistributables (VC++ runtimes, …) it
and the game need as part of the install. Running our generic winetricks
step on top is redundant and added a ~90s first-launch delay reinstalling
what UPC already provides. The per-game prefix (cloned from the UPC
template) is all that's required.

Every step is first-launch only (marker-guarded) and best-effort — a
failure logs and never blocks the launch.

    a different Proton than the one the game would otherwise use, and each

    ("Upgrading prefix from X to Y" / "Prefix has an invalid version?!"),
    erasing the very VC++ keys :mod:`compat.vcruntime` had just imported.

    Mirrors the steps' own guards rather than re-deriving them, so this can

    winetricks first (installs the redistributables), then the VC++
    registry fix (which assumes those DLLs are present). Each step is
    independently guarded so one failure doesn't skip the other or the
    launch.

    ``vcreg_plan`` runs the registry step under a DIFFERENT Proton from
    winetricks. Callers pass it when they had to borrow GE-Proton for the
    winetricks verb but the game will actually run under something else:
    the registry step must go last and under the *launch* Proton, because
    that first umu-run is what triggers that Proton's ``wineboot -u``
    prefix upgrade — and an upgrade AFTER the import would erase the keys
    the import just wrote. regedit, unlike winetricks, works fine under an
    official Valve Proton, so this is always possible.

    Returns ``True`` if any step was force-killed for exceeding its
    timeout — the signal that the selected Proton hung at runtime (a
    structurally-complete but broken build the static install check
    can't catch). The install-time warmup uses this to retry once with
    the managed GE-Proton; the launch path ignores it.
