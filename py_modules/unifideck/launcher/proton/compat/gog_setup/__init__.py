"""compat/gog_setup — GOG first-launch redistributable + script setup.

Faithful port of Heroic's ``setup.ts`` (staging's ``gog_setup.py``),
adapted to the launcher architecture and split for LOC control:

* :mod:`common`  — paths, manifest loaders, wine exec, lang map
* :mod:`redist`  — download (gogdl) + install redistributables
* :mod:`scripts` — scriptinterpreter / temp_executable + goggame-*.script

``apply_gog_setup(plan, language)`` is the single entry, called once per
prefix (marker-guarded) from the GOG handler before launch. Standalone
— imports nothing from ``unifideck.stores`` (the launcher's slim Python
can't load the GOG store's cryptography chain). Best-effort: failures
log and never block the launch, except a hard redistributable-install
failure which is surfaced to the caller.
