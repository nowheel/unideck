"""launcher/proton/handlers/ubisoft_recovery.py — find or rebuild a UPC prefix.

Split out of ``handlers/ubisoft.py`` (file-size cap). That module drives the
three UPC entry points — play, auth, install; this one answers the question all
three depend on: *where is a usable, signed-in UPC prefix for this game, and
can we rebuild one if it is gone?*

Dependencies point one way: ``ubisoft.py`` imports from here, never the
reverse. This module owns the UPC-location primitives (``find_upc_in``, the
template/base paths, the id_map file) precisely so both can share them without
an import cycle.

Recovery is ordered cheapest-first:

1. the prefix the plan resolved (the id_map pointer);
2. the same ``space_id`` under any other storage base the id_map knows about —
   the recorded pointer can be lost while the real prefix survives on SD;
3. a clone of the prebuilt ``.template``, which is a pure file copy (no umu).

Two things the clone must carry that a bare ``rsync -a`` gets wrong, both
confirmed live on 2026-08-01:

* the target's ``.unifideck_proton_version`` — the template ships a stale one
  and ``-a`` preserves mtime, so the copy silently reverts the marker the
  current launch just stamped, turning a one-off prefix reset into a permanent
  wipe-and-reclone loop; and
* the **credentials** — ``.template`` is deliberately pristine, so a bare clone
  is SIGNED OUT and hands the user a UPC demanding a sign-in they already did.
