"""bootstrap.teardown — clean shutdown sequence for the plugin.

Called from the Decky lifecycle hook ``Plugin._unload`` when the
plugin is being deactivated (reload, uninstall, or Steam Deck
shutdown). Ordering matters:

  1. Stop every Layer-5 service — they may still be emitting
     events on the bus; letting them run past this point would
     cause writes to dead collaborators.
  2. Stop the PriorityDispatcher — drains the pending queue
     so in-flight events complete before teardown continues.
  3. Clear the EventBus — releases all subscriptions; anything
     that still holds a reference to the bus after this point
     becomes a no-op emitter.

Each step logs its completion so operators debugging a stuck
unload can identify which stage failed. None of the steps
raises — teardown is best-effort; a failure in one stage must
not prevent the later stages from running.
