"""Multi-store library sync orchestrator.

OP-08l | py_modules/unifideck/core/sync_service.py

``SyncService`` walks every registered store, calls its
``get_library`` method, deduplicates the combined output, and
emits bus events at every stage so the frontend can render a
progress bar + per-store status.

This module holds construction, the single-flight queue
(``sync_all`` / ``_enqueue``), the bus event handlers, and
``cancel``. The per-run execution lives in ``_SyncRunMixin``
(``sync_run_mixin.py``), library-cache persistence in
``_SyncCacheMixin`` (``sync_cache_mixin.py``), read-only queries in
``_SyncQueriesMixin``, and result aggregation in
``_SyncResultsMixin`` — split for the 550-LOC volumetry cap; the
public API surface is unchanged.

State retained across sync passes:

* ``_all_games``       — per-store deduplicated library;
* ``_last_sync_time``  — wall-clock timestamp;
* ``_current_store``   — for progress display;
* ``_lock``            — single-flight (only one sync at a time);
* ``_cancel_event``    — cooperative cancel signal.
