r"""Bridge Unifideck prefixes into Steam's ``compatdata`` namespace.

py_modules/unifideck/core/compat_bridge.py

Unifideck keys its Wine prefixes on the *store* game id
(``~/.local/share/unifideck/prefixes/<game_id>``) so a prefix survives
shortcut regeneration — a Force Sync rewrites ``shortcuts.vdf`` but the
store id never changes. External Wine tooling, however, only knows about
Steam's layout: Protontricks resolves a non-Steam shortcut's prefix
*exclusively* at ``<steam_lib>/steamapps/compatdata/<u32 appid>/pfx``
(``find_appid_proton_prefix``) and silently skips any shortcut without
one. The result was that **no** Unifideck prefix was ever reachable from
Protontricks, while stale Steam-made ``compatdata`` dirs left over from
older launch paths *were* listed — so users edited a prefix the game
does not run in.

This module maintains a symlink

    steamapps/compatdata/<u32 appid>  ->  ~/.local/share/unifideck/prefixes/<game_id>

which needs no change to the prefix layout: umu already creates
``pfx -> .`` and ``pfx.lock`` at the prefix root, satisfying both of
Protontricks' gates (``prefix_path.is_dir()`` and
``(prefix_path.parent / "pfx.lock").is_file()``).

Stdlib-only by design — imported both by the Decky backend (bundled
Python 3.11) and by the out-of-process launcher (system ``/usr/bin/python3``,
3.10–3.14), same constraint as ``core/paths.py``.

All functions are synchronous and do blocking I/O; call them from a thread
(``asyncio.to_thread``) when on the event loop. Every one is best-effort:
a bridge failure must never fail an install, a launch, or an uninstall.
