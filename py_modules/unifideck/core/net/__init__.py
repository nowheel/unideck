"""TLS / SSL helpers — pre-built ``SSLContext`` factories.

OP-08e | py_modules/unifideck/core/net/__init__.py

Two factory functions for ``ssl.SSLContext``:

* ``ssl_ctx_strict``     — full hostname + certificate
  verification, used everywhere by default;
* ``ssl_ctx_permissive`` — skips hostname check, used only
  for the few stores that ship self-signed certs (CDP'd
  Microsoft login pages, certain Ubisoft endpoints).

Both factories return a fresh ``SSLContext`` per call so
callers can mutate it without affecting siblings.
