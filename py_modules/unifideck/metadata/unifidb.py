# Process-lifetime cache of fetched buckets.
#
# UnifiDB ships its catalog as static JSON files on jsdelivr's CDN —
# one file per ``<first-letter><second-letter-or-digit>`` bucket
# (about 36 buckets total, ``a.json``..``z.json`` + ``0_9.json`` etc.).
# A library of 1000+ games triggers ``lookup()`` once per game, but
# every game with the same prefix needs the SAME bucket — without
# memoisation the same file is downloaded ~30-60 times per sync.
#
# We memoise per (cdn_base, bucket) so a config change to point at a
# fork doesn't accidentally hit stale data. The cache is in-memory
# only: it dies with the plugin process, and the next sync re-fetches.
# That's the right TTL because:
#   1. UnifiDB updates are rare (manual PRs to the mubaraknumann/unifiDB
#      repo) — staleness within a single sync is impossible.
#   2. jsdelivr's edge cache has its own ~12h TTL so a fresh fetch is
#      cheap, no need to mirror it ourselves.
#   3. Eliminates the need for a CacheManager namespace + disk persistence
#      for what is essentially a request-coalescing optimisation.
#
# The lock prevents two concurrent ``lookup()`` calls for games in the
# same bucket from both issuing the underlying HTTP request — the
# second waits and reads from the cache. Important because
# MetadataService's new game-level concurrency (semaphore=5) means
# multiple ``lookup()`` calls can be in flight at once.
