/**
 * useGameSize — lazy, non-blocking "Space Required" / "Installed
 * Size" fetch.
 *
 * The size lookup lives in its own RPC (`get_game_size_bytes`)
 * rather than in `get_game_info`, because resolving a download
 * size shells out to `legendary info` / `gogdl` (subprocess /
 * network) and can take seconds. `usePlaySection` + the game-info
 * panel both gate on `get_game_info`, so doing the size work there
 * stalled the whole custom UI behind Steam's native section. This
 * hook fetches the size separately, in an effect, exactly like
 * `MetaInline` already does for Last Played — the row renders
 * immediately and the size fills in a moment later.
 *
 * The cache is keyed by `"<appId>:<installed>"`, NOT `appId` alone:
 * the backend returns the *download* size while not-installed and
 * the *on-disk* size once installed, so a game that finishes
 * installing shows the right number rather than the stale pre-install
 * one. The module-level cache also de-dupes the fetch so the
 * play-section `MetaInline` and the info-panel size cell share one
 * round-trip.
 *
 * That key used to be the ONLY invalidation, on the reasoning that the
 * install-state transition is a natural cache miss. It is not enough.
 * A wrapper store (Ubisoft, Battle.net) once reported "installed" the
 * moment its Wine prefix was created, so the prefix-only measurement
 * landed under the same `<appId>:1` key the finished install would
 * read — and with no other invalidation, that wrong number was served
 * for the rest of the Steam session. Sizes are now forgotten
 * explicitly via `lib/game-size-cache`, which also covers the cases the
 * key never could: a game growing on update or shrinking when DLC goes.
