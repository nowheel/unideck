/**
 * Domain hooks subpackage — barrel export.
 *
 * Each hook in this package wraps one or more contexts
 * (Phase F2) and exposes a focused, business-oriented API
 * that components can call without juggling multiple
 * contexts manually. The 9 hooks cover the entire frontend's
 * interaction surface: auth, install/launch actions, game
 * info fetching, view-mode persistence, play-section state,
 * download progress, toasts, and Steam library access.
 *
 * Rule of thumb: components import from this barrel; they
 * NEVER reach into individual hook files. Renaming an
 * internal hook is therefore a one-file change in this
 * package.
