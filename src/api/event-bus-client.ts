/**
 * Bidirectional bridge to the backend EventBus.
 *
 * Backend emits events on its in-process Python EventBus.
 * Decky doesn't expose a server-push channel, so we use
 * `subscribe_replay(events)` which returns a snapshot of the
 * recent buffered events with their full kwargs payload. We
 * deduplicate by timestamp on the frontend side ; any event
 * we've already dispatched is filtered out.
 *
 * Reverse direction : `dispatch_unifideck_action(uri)` lets
 * the frontend trigger a backend action (auth, retry-sync,
 * refresh-library, ...). The URI form is
 * `unifideck://<verb>[/arg1/arg2]`. Toast/modal payloads
 * coming through events embed an optional `action` block
 * which the UI exposes as a button — clicking it dispatches
 * the corresponding URI back to the backend.
 *
 * Polling cadence is adaptive : 250ms when an operation is
 * in flight (events arriving), 2s when idle.
