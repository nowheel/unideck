/**
 * PlaySectionWrapper — dispatcher for the Play section.
 *
 * Reads `usePlaySection(appId)` and renders one of the
 * sub-components based on the discriminated state. While the
 * game info is still resolving, a `PlayLoadingSkeleton` keeps the
 * row from collapsing.
 *
 * It also renders the scoped CSS rules ({@link nativeAppDetailsHideCss})
 * that hide Steam's native Play row and the lower tabbed section
 * (Activity / Community / Game Info). Those live in a *separate*
 * subtree (so they can't be removed in-tree); the `AppDetailsPatch`
 * marks a common ancestor and these rules hide the targets beneath
 * it — synchronous, no RPC/CDP round-trip. The rules render
 * unconditionally so the native UI never paints on a shortcut page,
 * even before `get_game_info` resolves.
 *
 * The wrapper itself is pure presentation : the decision logic is
 * in `usePlaySection`, the actions are in `useGameActions`. This
 * component just glues them.
