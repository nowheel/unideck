/**
 * CaptureLogsSection — one-tap diagnostic bundle for bug reports.
 *
 * Calls `capture_logs`, which collects every plugin, launch and state
 * artifact from wherever it actually lives on the device, audits every
 * path the plugin can touch, probes the machine, scrubs credentials, and
 * writes one zip into the user's Downloads folder.
 *
 * The resulting path is surfaced twice on purpose: in a toast, and in a
 * row that stays in the panel. The user needs to read that path while
 * typing a bug report, long after a 5-second toast is gone.
 *
 * `lastCapture` is module-level rather than component state because
 * Decky tears the whole Quick Access panel down on dismiss — the same
 * reason QuickAccessPanel keeps its active tab outside React. Component
 * state alone would lose the path the moment the user closed the panel
 * to go find the file.
