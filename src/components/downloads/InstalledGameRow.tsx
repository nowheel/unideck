/**
 * InstalledGameRow — one installed game in the Downloads tab's
 * "Installed" section.
 *
 * The section this belongs to exists because the tab used to list only
 * downloads *this plugin had performed in its capped history*, so a game
 * installed before the plugin — or eleven downloads ago — was invisible, and
 * the only way to make it appear was to uninstall and reinstall it. The list
 * is now derived from actual install state, so it always reflects the disk.
 *
 * Play and Uninstall both need a Steam appId, which we resolve from the
 * shortcut cache; a game with no shortcut yet (synced but not written) is
 * rendered without actions rather than hidden, so the list still matches the
 * user's library.
