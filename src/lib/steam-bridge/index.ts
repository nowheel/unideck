/**
 * SteamBridge — barrel export.
 *
 * The single entry point for code that needs to interact
 * with Steam's CEF-injected globals (App Details, Router,
 * appStore lookups). Components import from this barrel and
 * never reach into `react-tree.ts` / `app-details-classes.ts`
 * directly.
 *
 * Rule of thumb : if a Steam internal name appears in a
 * component file, the component is doing it wrong. Push the
 * call into a SteamBridge method, return a typed result.
