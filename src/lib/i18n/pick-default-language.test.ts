/**
 * Tests for the install language picker's pre-selection.
 *
 * The regression that prompted these: Epic's Selective Downloads
 * configs list only the *additional* language packs a title offers —
 * English is the untagged base game and so appears nowhere in the list.
 * Fed that list, `pickDefaultLanguage` fell through "user's language"
 * and "English" to `options[0]` and pre-selected **Deutsch**, so an
 * English user who accepted the dialog downloaded a German voice pack.
 *
 * The backend now always includes a base-language entry for such titles
 * (`py_modules/unifideck/stores/epic/sdl.py`); these tests pin both
 * halves — that a present English choice always beats the positional
 * fallback, and what that fallback does when it has nothing to work with.
