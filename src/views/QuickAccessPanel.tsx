/**
 * QuickAccessPanel — top-level Decky tab content.
 *
 * Replaces the legacy `<Content>` component (1305 LOC)
 * which mixed sync state, account switch logic, downloads,
 * settings, language selection, and a custom tab switcher.
 * Maps each section to its dedicated component
 * (StoreConnections, LibrarySync, StorageSettings,
 * LanguageSelector, DownloadsTab).
 *
 * Tab state is held in a module-level `persistentActiveTab`
 * so the last-viewed tab survives Quick-Access dismount /
 * remount (legacy behaviour from staging index.tsx). Steam's
 * automatic focus pass on mount used to defeat that — see
 * `autoFocusConsumed` in the component.
 *
 * Tab buttons are `Focusable`s carrying Steam's own `Tab` /
 * `Selected` classes, inside a `flow-children="row"` row.
 * They are NOT `DialogButton`s: Steam's tab styling assumes a
 * bare element, and DialogButton's own chrome fights it.
 *
 * Each tab needs its own `onActivate` — a `Focusable` with no
 * interactive children is not a focus target without one. The
 * older warning here (that wrapping in an extra `Focusable`
 * swallows focus) applied to wrapping a *DialogButton*; a
 * Focusable-as-tab with `onActivate` is a different construct
 * and does take focus. Verified on-device.
